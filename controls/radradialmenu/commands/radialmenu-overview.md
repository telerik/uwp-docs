# Overview

The *Command* design pattern is very important and widely used in the XAML and MVVM world.
**RadRadialMenu** strictly follows these best practices and provides an intuitive and easy-to-use set of APIs that allow different aspects
of the RadRadialMenu control's behavior to be handled and/or completely overridden.

There are two types of commands associated with the **RadRadialMenu** control:

* [RadialMenu Control Commands]({%slug radialmenu-commands-radialmenucontrolcommands%}): a set of commands executed when the visual state of the **RadRadialMenu** control is changed.
* [RadialMenuItem Command]({%slug radialmenu-commands-radialmenuitemcommand%}): **RadRadialMenuItem** provides a bindable **Command** property that allows command execution when the user clicks/taps on the menu item.
