# Overview

>RadDataGrid is available for **Windows 8.1**.

Most of the data on the Internet is stored in tables within a database.
**RadDataGrid** provides the same abstraction over the data – it has Columns and Rows and the intersection of a Row and a Column is called a Cell.
When the data from a database is sent to the client, it is usually converted to a Business object (or the so-called ViewModel) where each instance represents a Table Row and each property of the object represents a Column within the original table.

**RadDataGrid** Key Features:

* **[Data Storage Provider]({%slug raddatagrid-datastorageprovider-overview%})**
